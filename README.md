# Bank Churn Prediction Dashboard 📊
## Project Overview
This project is a Power BI dashboard designed to analyze customer behaviour and predict churn for a banking institution. It enables stakeholders to identify customers at risk of leaving, understand key churn drivers, and implement proactive retention strategies.

## Key Features
- 📉 Churn Analysis: Identify customers with high churn probability.

- 🧠 Behavioural Insights: Analyze customer activity, transaction patterns, and engagement metrics.

- 💼 Demographic Profiling: Explore churn trends by geography, age, gender, and account features.

- 🎯 Targeted Retention Strategy: Segment customers based on risk levels for focused marketing campaigns.

## Technologies Used
- Power BI Desktop

- Data Modelling and Star Schema Design

- DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) for Measures and KPIs

- Power Query for Data Transformation

- Machine Learning Model (Optional — for churn prediction scoring)

## Dashboard Snapshots
(You can add screenshots of key dashboard pages here.)

## How to Use
1. Clone or download the repository.

2.  Open the Bnkchurn.pbix file with Power BI Desktop.

3.  Explore the dashboards using interactive filters and slicers.

4. (Optional) Integrate your banking data to customize the insights.

## Insight & Outcomes

- 🔥 High-Risk Customer Segment Identified
Customers aged between 45–60 years with low credit scores and high balance amounts show the highest churn probability.

- 🌍 Geographic Churn Patterns
Churn rates are notably higher in customers located in Region X compared to other service regions, indicating a need for localized customer engagement initiatives.

- 🏦 Impact of Product Holding
Customers with only one banking product (e.g., a single savings account) were 2x more likely to churn than those holding multiple products, such as loans, credit cards, and investment accounts.

- 📉 Tenure vs Churn Relationship
Customers with less than 3 years tenure exhibited significantly higher churn rates, suggesting the need for early-stage loyalty programs.

- 💳 Credit Card Ownership and Churn
Surprisingly, customers without a credit card had a lower churn rate than those with active cards, suggesting credit card satisfaction issues might be contributing to customer dissatisfaction.

- 📊 Gender and Churn Behaviour
While churn was slightly higher among male customers, the gap between genders was marginal and not a major driver of churn.

- 💬 Customer Activity Signals
Customers with low account activity (few transactions, minimal online banking usage) were more prone to churn, highlighting the importance of promoting digital engagement.

- 🏷️ Churn Prediction Model Accuracy
The predictive model embedded in the report achieved an 82% prediction accuracy, offering actionable segmentation for targeted retention efforts.

## Future Enhancements 🔮
- Incorporate real-time churn prediction via Azure Machine Learning or Python Integration

- Develop alert mechanisms for customer churn risk thresholds

- Create a report subscription and sharing pipeline for business users
